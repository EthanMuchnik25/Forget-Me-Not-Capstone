# To run with Docker container

### Docker for vscode
If you want to modify files in your docker container in vscode, install the `Remote-Containers` extension and connect to the container with `ctrl+shift+P -> Attach to Running Container`

## Prod Container

### Create Container

cd into this directory (webserver) and type:
```
docker build -t myapp .
```
my_app is the container name, but you can rename it if you wish

Next, to run the container, type:
```
docker run -p 4000:80 myapp
```
Note that this commands sets port 80 of the docker container as port 4000 of your computer. In this case, you would have to access the website through [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). If you don't want to have to specify a port, map port 80 directly to port 80.


## Debug Container

With the debug container, you can edit the files in your computer's local directory and the changes will appear in the container. Additionally, this container doesn't automatically run gunicorn, allowing the user to enter the container with a shell, and easily restart gunicorn to keep up with modifications to the source code.

cd into this directory and type:
```
docker build -f ./Dockerfile-dbg -t myapp-dbg .
```
my_app is the container name, but you can rename it if you wish

Next, to run the container, and enter a shell on it, type:
```
docker run -v $(pwd)/:/webserver -p 4000:80 -it --entrypoint /bin/bash --name myapp-dbg myapp-dbg
```

Once you are in a shell in the container, you first want to start nginx because the dockerfile is stupid ;-;. Type this in the terminal:
```
nginx
service nginx status 
```
This command must be run whenever you restart the container.

Next, you will want to run gunicorn to get the server operational. To do this, type: 
```
gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py --workers 2 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myapp:app
```

If you would like to get back into a shell on the container after leaving, type:
```
docker restart myapp-dbg
docker exec -it myapp-dbg /bin/bash 
```


# To Run Server Locally:

## Python setup:

These instructions assume you have python already installed.

### Create python virtual environment:

Start by making a python virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
This creates a python virtual environment in a directory called '.venv'.

### Activate python virtual environment:
Next, activate the environment by typing:
```
. .venv/bin/activate
```
You will always need to type this command when you open up a new terminal and want to run this python stuff locally.

### Install dependncies:

Now that you have the virtual environment set up, install the necessary dependancies by running:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
This only needs to be run when you run the server for the first time. If you would like to add more dependancies to the project, add them to requirements.txt

## nginx setup:

Install nginx. On debian-based linux, this can probably be done with:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Next, we need to ensure nginx is using the correct configuration file. By default, it uses the file in the symlink `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`. We need to either comment out everything in the file, or delete it and replace it with our own. In our case, place `nginx.conf` in `/etc/nginx/sites-available`, symlink it to the `sites-enabled` directory, and delete/comment the default file.
```
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo cp nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Afterwards make sure to reload nginx
```
sudo nginx -t # Test for syntax errors
sudo systemctl reload nginx # Reload nginx to apply changes
```
Note: systemctl may not work if you have a different linux setup. Ask chatgpt what to do in that case or something lmao.

To start nginx running, type:
```
sudo service nginx start
```

## Running gunicorn:

You should run something like:
```
gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py --workers 1 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myapp:app
```
`myapp` is the name of the python file containing the server stuff, and `app` is the name of the variable bound to `Flask(__name__)` inside the python file.

If we wish to handle websocket connections, we would need to modify something here. We might add a flag like --worker-class eventlet.

## Querying Server
The server can be sent requests locally at "http://127.0.0.1:8000" or "http://localhost"

To send requests from a different computer, type `ip addr show` in the terminal. The correct ip address is the one on the line starting with `inet`.\
Alternatively, `hostname -I` seems to work as well, pick the first ip address\
Once you have the ip address, you can send requests from a different computer at ["http://\<ip-addr\>"](http://<ip-addr>). 


## Additional notes:
#### How to know if nginx is running:
```
sudo systemctl status nginx # or
sudo service nginx status
```
To check if the port is listening correctly, type:
```
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 80 # or
curl -I http://localhost
```

#### How to disable nginx run on system reboot
By default, nginx is set to run when your system reboots. To check if this is currently the case, type:
```
sudo systemctl is-enabled nginx
```

To turn this behavior off, type:
```
sudo systemctl disable nginx
```

## Raspi Setup

Nothing special, see [Docker Notes](./docker_commands.md) for instructions on how to install docker on raspberry pi.

Follow instructions online on how to flash your rpi sd card, or enable ssh.

## NVIDIA Jetson

Follow [these instructions](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-2gb-devkit).

Important:
- Download image from site
- lsblk
  - Unmount partition if sd card is auto mounted
- unzip jetson___.zip
  - `unzip ~Downloads/jetson-nano-2gb-jp461-sd-card-image.zip`
- sudo /bin/dd if=~/Downloads/___.img of=/dev/SD_DIRECTORY bs=1M status=progress
  - `sudo /bin/dd if=~/Downloads/sd-blob.img of=/dev/mmcblk0  bs=1M status=progress`
- sudo eject /dev/mmcblk0
